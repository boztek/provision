To test this:

drush provision-save @server_localhost --dns_service_type=bind
drush @server_localhost provision-zone create foobar.com
drush @server_localhost provision-zone rr-add foobar.com www A 1.2.3.4

You should end up with a zonefile like:

; Bind zonefile
; File managed by Aegir
; Changes here may be lost by user configurations, tread carefully
$TTL 
@       IN      SOA     foobar.com. hostmaster.foobar.com. ( 2010061700 21600 3600 604800 86400  ) 
www     IN      A       1.2.3.4

Caveats:

 1. only targeting bind right now
 2. the global $TTL is broken
 3. no way to regenerate the whole file: we edit the file piece by
 piece (which has the advantage of not requiring backend storage)

Todo:

 1. we're not hooked into site tasks properly (yet)
 2. we need slave configurations to be shipped
 3. we need to hook the zones into the bind configuration
 4. we don't have NS records, we should rely on the master/slave
 servers defined in the backend for that
 5. we don't have a notion of "IP" for sites yet, nor any notion of
 "defauult IP", we need to hook into the server stuff for that
